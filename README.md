My personal portfolio website to showcase my experience, projects, and such. Check it out at [https://ponleou.github.io/portfolio/](https://ponleou.github.io/portfolio/) (no money for a personal domain unfortunately 😔).

Made purely with React.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind.css. 

Main repository is on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ponleou/portfolio), however, [GitHub](https://github.com/ponleou/portfolio) is still used for Workflow Actions to serve PRs and Pages.

Feel free to take inspiration, ideas, or even give me feedback!
